Exercise Instructions:
A list of integers is called a "balanced list" if it satisfies
the following conditions:
The number of positive elements is equal to the number
of negative elements.
The list does not include zeros.
Write a function that takes a list of integers as input. If
the list is balanced, print it from the beginning to the end
in one line. If it is not balanced, print it in reverse order,
from the end to the beginning.
